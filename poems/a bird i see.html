NOTE:
Don't look at the picture and start imagining things—
I never expected it. Drawn by AI.
Never by me 😂😂

ALSO:
I don’t really know anything .
Maybe something about a husband… or a person? ,
I don’t think.
Imaginary things , a mother-in-law,
A person wanted  to take in,
A person wanting to take it,
Or even a doubt about marriage thing...
The person I see,
An imagination beyond what I can think.

A reaction I never expected to see.
An injury , Lost in dimension i see .
Coming and going talking about a person ,
We dont know even exist.

Poem :
Something i always see ,
I have been thinking,
May be following.

Please dont be mad at me ,
I just wanted test my ,
Writing. 

 < Hahaha >
 
This is not something,
I can show.
This is a happiness ,
I dont want to let go.

Your luck end here ,
Because rest you will not be shown.

< Hahaha >
< Good luck >
