An illusion—
a state where dreams come true,
where I see a loved one,
see death, see magic and see peace.

A world of wonders—
where I want to live and die.
Free from shackles and pain,
where I want to fly.

I want to go there alone,
with the humming melody following me—
a world, a place,
where I always wanted to be.

A world full of imagination—
who doesn't want that?
I did.

But now I see all the reality,
as it keeps pulling me,
to a darker side
where I never wanted to be,
buried with shadows ,
where i couldn’t see.

Others push me as I go deeper,
and reality keeps hitting me
like a checkerboard of pain,
as I try to find the surface
where I once flew free.

An illusion keeps checking on me.
The girl I saw yesterday
was a little girl grown in a day—
maybe tomorrow
I'll see her as a child.

But how can I show her my feelings
if I never wanted her?
Yet I long for her.
The place we used to talk,
walk,
where we whispered sweet things—
now filled with fog.

The distance between us has grown so wide.
From afar, I used to see you wave…
now you’ve disappeared.
The closer I felt,
the more you disappeard.
The illusion kept me blind.

The more I reached for closure,
the more distant you became.
The closer I got,
the farther you traveled.

The waving that once belonged to me—
now directed toward a stranger.
Like a river flooded with water,
I was scattered.

My eyes filled with tear more i lost .
Now, I see the dead and a
place i wanted to be,
to see that person—
whether dream or illusion,
I just want to see.

All i wanted was to see,
Was a butterfly with you,
Which my friends used to say.
Now you left with another,
for a better opportunity.

Fly like a beautiful butterfly—
all eyes on me.
I want to die,
quickly and quietly,
as everyone remembers
what I wanted to be.

The more pain I endured in life,
the happiest where the person,
I dont want to see.
The distance you created,
has grown too wide,
where i cant reach.

Where I once saw sunshine,
I now see blacklight.
The dark fire inside me
has grown wild.
And yet, when I look at the sky,
I feel warmer—
because maybe,
that’s where I’ll die.

This is a phase.
I see what i wanted to see,
I wrote about a girl who has grown big
but the thing I held for her 
has vanished in illusion where 
my last resting place used to be.
