the sky was quiet
but i heard your voice
not calling—
just echoing
like it used to.

i looked at the chair
you never sat on
still warm
from a dream
i didn’t finish.

do you think
a heart breaks
once?
or a little
every time
it remembers
you never came back?

the window stares at me
i stare back
maybe
we’re both waiting
for something
that never meant to return.
