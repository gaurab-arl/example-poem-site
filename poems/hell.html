Censure of white haze—
Feel that gaze,
Staring down a prey.
Just one gulp,
And it’s the end.

Floating pieces—masses—
Lifeless.

A person far away, 
beside someone
Still breathing, still alive—
But it feels like a game.

I ride a moving train,
Away from place.
What’s the starting point?
My death.

Complain, complain—
Complications.
Call a doctor, look at me:
This leg, this body—
Bones broken,
Popping like a debate.

A creepy voice
From a gentle girl,
With a smiling face:
“Haha... is that you,
My love—
Still waiting for peace in a HELL?”

I killed her.
From my eyes, she saw inside—
A portal, a gateway,
To somewhere—
A beautiful place.
The one I’ll go to, once I die.

A board hung above the door,
Carved in flame:
“WELCOME TO HELL, MY DEAREST.”

A sin of pride,
A sin of lust—
All seven sins
Welcome me, heart in hand.

Ask me—whose hearts?
They’re theirs.
I am their leader,
Their liberator.

Follow my lead.
Follow my path.
Let’s walk into fire,
Burn all in sight—
Child, young, old, woman or man.

This is my realm,
The place where I rule
Don’t call anyone innocent—
All are demons,
Wearing flesh
But forged from flame.

A enternal flames
Not even a child is spared
All have commited sins 
Let me burn them in my place.
