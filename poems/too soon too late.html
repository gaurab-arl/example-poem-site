            The Crystal-Like Tear
            I looked through your eyes and saw you crying—
            Never thought I'd even get a clue.
            What was that clue I believed I’d received?
            I never knew it was a signal…
            
            A signal breaking through the heart—
            I never thought we’d drift this far apart.
            
            I gave everything, yet was left with nothing.
            I thought it was a good bet,
            But I lost more than I had.
            
            I saw a girl singing beside a mirror,
            And in it—reflected was my face.
            That was the day I realized…
            My actual place.
            
            Getting too close—that was my mistake.
            Staying too far—that's the regret I made.
            
            When I tried to go back,
            I found the path lost.
            It’s better to walk straight
            Than to jump into a dark place.
            
            Look at my face—
            Seems I got caught.
            
            I thought I had a feeling,
            But maybe it was none—
            A moment mistaken for ----.
            
            The vibration I felt shocked me.
            Never thought the pain I saw in myself
            Was showing through my eyes.
            Later, I realized—I was blind.
            
            When she understood,
            She thought I was a fool—
            But what the thing,
            Was i any good.
            
            The smile she had
            When she got what she wanted
            Was so beautiful…
            I never thought I'd be left puzzled.
            
            Looking through her eyes,
            I saw excitement—
            A light I never thought
            Would shine with me by her side.
            
            That was the last time I saw her nearby.
            It was a day I tried to make things smooth—
            By saying,
            "Today’s my second birthday this year."
            I tried to make her laugh,
            But it was me who ended up in tears.
            
            I never knew her again,
            Never saw her again—
            Though I remember.
            I searched everywhere,
            Just to find… she had disappeared.
            
            And as a person—
            At last, I realized
            I made her uncomfortable.
            I never wanted to.
            
            Tried to make things better,
            But found it was too soon…
            Then realized—
            It was too late.
            
            Was god good, 
            That he removed me to make her,
            What was the misunderstanding that caused her.
            
            I wished He’d take away
            Everything that affect her.
            I never thought
            I’d be the first on that list
            To disappear.
            
            I thought I was being seen…
            But I was never looked at.
            Heard my inner voice crying—
            Tried to calm it down,
            But once I knew the truth…
            I cried out loud.
            
            We laughed together,
            We cried together—
            Never thought
            That would be best part of life.
            That would be the final day,
            When even affection
            Began to struggle.
            
            I feel tired…
            I want to sleep.
            
            Sometimes, I dream—
            Of the hand that used to feed me,
            Wishing for me to grow and be big.
            Then I realize…
            It was just a dream.
            
            Trapped in an illusion,
            I never thought I'd wake up.
            
            My eyes felt like water—
            But when I looked into the mirror,
            It was a crystal-like tear.
